# odin-recipes
This is the project that i will build basic website for food recipes.
Now to begin with building, I start to collect images and resources of steps and description on https://www.allrecipes.com/. After that, I tried to organize all the images i downloaded to odin-recipes/recipes/img and created index.html in odin-recipes. Following the session, I created 3 more recipes which are lasagna, stuffed-eggplants and zucchini for the purpose of this website.
